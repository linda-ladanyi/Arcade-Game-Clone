# Linda's Arcade Game: The Shopping Trip!

## Game concept

In this game you have a player and cars as enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds from left to right. If the player collides with an enemy, the player loses a day and will be moved back to the starting position. The score increses each time the player reaches the shops. Every 3 times the player reaches the shops the level will increase and one enemy will be added and their speed will be increased.

## Goal

The goal is to get the player to the shops on top and get as many gifts as possible, without colliding into any one of the enemies!

## How to play

- First, select your avatar from the starting screen. Click one of the images (if not the default boy image will be loaded).
- Use the up, down, left and right arrow keys to move your avatar.
- You goal is to buy gifts for the party by reaching the shops across the street. But look out for cars! If you get hit by a car, you'll get hurt and you have to quit for the day. You only have three days to get as many gifts as possible. Money is no issue! :)
